 Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark
The objective of this task was to perform a live network capture using Wireshark, analyze the resulting data, and identify key communication protocols. This project demonstrates a practical understanding of network packet analysis, protocol behavior, and the use of professional network monitoring tool


Tools & Environment
Packet Analyzer: Wireshark
Operating System: Kali Linux

 Procedure
Launched Wireshark: Started Wireshark with sudo privileges in the Kali Linux terminal to gain access to network interfaces.

Initiated Capture: Began a live packet capture on the primary network interface (eth0).

Generated Network Traffic: To create a diverse data set for analysis, traffic was generated by:

Pinging an external server (ping 8.8.8.8) to produce ICMP packets.

Browsing a website to produce DNS, TCP, and HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

Saved & Analyzed: After approximately one minute, the capture was stopped. The resulting data was saved to a .pcapng file. Display filters were then applied in Wireshark to isolate and examine specific protocols.


Protocols Identified & Analyzed
During the packet analysis, the following three core protocols were identified and inspected:

DNS (Domain Name System): These packets were observed resolving human-readable domain names into IP addresses, a fundamental first step in most network connections.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): TCP packets demonstrated the reliable, connection-oriented nature of web browsing, including the classic three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) used to establish a session.

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Generated by the ping command, these packets showed the "Echo request" and "Echo reply" messages used for network diagnostics a# Network-traffic-analysis-with-wireshark
The objective of this task was to capture, analyze, and identify different protocols from live network traffic. This project demonstrates hands-on skills in packet analysis and a practical understanding of core networking concepts.
